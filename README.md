# The-Warden
A Discord based RP plugin for economies, user profiles, guilds and more!

Currently this is being made as a hobby side project by someone with not a lot of coding experience. You can use it if you want but it can be very unstable at times and might be hard to rebuild later on down the line.

Required Python packages:
- discord
- mysql.connector
- pyyaml
- mcuuid

# Version 0.1

this was my venture to make the fundamentals of the bot. The code is not great but it works. I am currently developing V1.0 which will be a total rewrite
Why am i doing a rewrite within a week of writing the code?

I am a fast learner and i learned a lot of how to greatly improve my code. Instead of bodging update after update into the same bits of code i decided to rewrite everything because that woud be less work.
