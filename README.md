# The-Warden
A Discord based RP plugin for economies, user profiles, guilds and more!

Currently this is being made as a hobby side project by someone with not a lot of coding experience. You can use it if you want but it can be very unstable at times and might be hard to rebuild later on down the line.

Required Python packages:
- discord
- mysql.connector
- pyyaml
- mcuuid
